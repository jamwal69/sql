## 🚀 How to Create New Agent (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Copy Template Files

```powershell
# Create new business folder
mkdir "c:\Ai Agent\businesses\my_shop"

# Copy template files
copy "c:\Ai Agent\template\*.template.json" "c:\Ai Agent\businesses\my_shop\"

# Rename files (remove .template)
cd businesses\my_shop
ren business_config.template.json business_config.json
ren policies.template.json policies.json
ren products.template.json products.json
ren known_issues.template.json known_issues.json
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Business

Edit these files with your business details:

**business_config.json**
```json
{
  "business_info": {
    "name": "My Electronics Shop",
    "industry": "Electronics"
  },
  "agent_config": {
    "agent_name": "TechBot"
  },
  "contact_info": {
    "email": "support@myshop.com",
    "phone": "+919876543210"
  }
}
```

**policies.json** - Add your return policy, warranty, shipping

**products.json** - Add your product catalog

**known_issues.json** - Add common product issues

### Step 3: Generate Agent

```powershell
# Generate the agent
python generate_agent.py --business "my_shop"

# The generator will:
# ✅ Validate your config files
# ✅ Generate .env file
# ✅ Create custom_rag.py with your data
# ✅ Copy core system files
# ✅ Generate README.md

# Start your agent
cd businesses\my_shop
