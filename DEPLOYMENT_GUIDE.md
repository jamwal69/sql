## 🌐 Website Integration

### Architecture Overview
```
Your Website (Frontend)
    ↓ (HTTP/WebSocket)
Backend API Server (Flask/FastAPI)
    ↓ (Function calls)
Agentic AI Agent
    ↓ (Tools)
Database + RAG System
```

### Step 1: Create Backend API Server

I'll create a production-ready FastAPI server with authentication:
- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket for real-time chat
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- CORS enabled
- Session management

### Step 2: Frontend Integration

**Option A: Chat Widget (Embedded)**
```html
<!-- Add to your website -->
<script src="https://yoursite.com/chat-widget.js"></script>
<div id="support-chat"></div>
```

**Option B: Dedicated Page**
```
yoursite.com/support
```

**Option C: API Integration**
```javascript
// Your website calls API
fetch('https://api.yoursite.com/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer USER_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Where is my order?'
  })
})
```

## 📱 WhatsApp Integration

### Using Twilio WhatsApp API

```
Customer WhatsApp → Twilio → Your Backend → Agentic AI → Response
```

### Setup Process:

1. **Get Twilio Account**
   - Sign up at twilio.com
   - Get WhatsApp-enabled number
   - Get API credentials

2. **Configure Webhook**
   - Point to your backend: `https://api.yoursite.com/whatsapp/webhook`
   - Twilio sends messages here

3. **Authentication via WhatsApp**
   - Customer sends: "Hi, I'm Rohan, order ORD-123"
   - AI identifies them automatically
   - Stores session

---

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### Core Security Principles

**1. Customer can only see THEIR data**
```python
# ❌ BAD - No security
def get_order(order_id):
    return database.get_order(order_id)  # Anyone can access any order!

# ✅ GOOD - Secured
def get_order(order_id, authenticated_user):
    order = database.get_order(order_id)
    if order.customer_id != authenticated_user.customer_id:
        raise PermissionDenied("You can only view your own orders")
    return order
```

**2. Authentication Methods**

**Option A: JWT Token (For Website)**
```
User logs in → Backend issues JWT token → Token included in all requests
```

**Option B: Session-based (For WhatsApp)**
```
Phone number verified → Session created → Session validated each message
```

**Option C: OTP Verification**
```
User: "I'm Rohan"
AI: "I'll send OTP to your registered phone"
User enters OTP → Authenticated
```

### Security Layers

```
Layer 1: Authentication (Who are you?)
    ↓
Layer 2: Authorization (What can you access?)
    ↓
Layer 3: Data Filtering (Only your data)
    ↓
Layer 4: Rate Limiting (Prevent abuse)
    ↓
Layer 5: Audit Logging (Track all actions)
```

---

## 👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Roles Definition

```python
ROLES = {
    "customer": {
        "can_view": ["own_orders", "own_profile", "policies"],
        "can_modify": ["own_profile"],
        "can_create": ["support_tickets"],
        "cannot_access": ["other_customers", "admin_panel", "all_orders"]
    },
    "support_agent": {
        "can_view": ["customer_profiles", "orders", "tickets", "policies"],
        "can_modify": ["tickets", "order_status"],
        "can_create": ["refunds", "returns", "adjustments"],
        "cannot_access": ["admin_panel", "financial_reports"]
    },
    "admin": {
        "can_view": ["everything"],
        "can_modify": ["everything"],
        "can_create": ["everything"],
        "cannot_access": []  # Full access
    },
    "owner": {
        "can_view": ["everything"],
        "can_modify": ["everything"],
        "can_create": ["everything"],
        "special_privileges": ["delete_data", "manage_agents", "view_analytics"]
    }
}
```

### Access Control Examples

**Example 1: Customer (Rohan) viewing orders**
```python
User: Rohan (customer_id: CUST-123)
Request: "Show me all orders"

AI filters:
- ✅ Shows: Orders where customer_id == CUST-123
- ❌ Hides: All other customer orders
```

**Example 2: Support Agent viewing orders**
```python
User: Emma (support_agent)
Request: "Show order ORD-456"

AI checks:
- ✅ Allowed: Can view any customer order
- ✅ Allowed: Can process returns, refunds
- ❌ Blocked: Cannot delete orders
- ❌ Blocked: Cannot view financial reports
```

**Example 3: Owner viewing analytics**
```python
User: You (owner)
Request: "Show me all orders today"

AI checks:
- ✅ Allowed: Full access to all data
- ✅ Allowed: Can see analytics
- ✅ Allowed: Can manage everything
```

## 🔧 Implementation

Let me create the production files for you:

1. **Secure Backend API** (`api_server.py`)
2. **Authentication System** (`auth_system.py`)
3. **WhatsApp Integration** (`whatsapp_integration.py`)
4. **Security Middleware** (`security.py`)
5. **Frontend Chat Widget** (`chat_widget.html` + `chat_widget.js`)
6. **Deployment Guide** (Docker + Cloud)

These will include:
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Data filtering by user
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ WhatsApp webhook handling
- ✅ WebSocket for real-time chat
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

## 🎯 Customer Journey Example

### Scenario: Rohan checks his order

**Step 1: Authentication**
```
Rohan visits: yoursite.com/support
    ↓
Backend: "Who are you?"
    ↓
Rohan logs in with email/password or OTP
    ↓
Backend issues JWT token: "token_rohan_123"
```

**Step 2: Secure Chat**
```
Rohan: "Where is my order?"
    ↓
Frontend sends: {
    message: "Where is my order?",
    token: "token_rohan_123"
}
    ↓
Backend validates token → Identifies: Rohan (CUST-123)
    ↓
AI agent receives: {
    message: "Where is my order?",
    authenticated_user: {
        customer_id: "CUST-123",
        role: "customer"
    }
}
    ↓
AI searches orders WHERE customer_id = "CUST-123" ONLY
    ↓
Returns: "Your order ORD-789 is arriving tomorrow!"
```

**Step 3: Access Control in Action**
```
Scenario A: Rohan tries to see someone else's order
Rohan: "Show me order ORD-999" (belongs to Michael)

AI checks:
- Order ORD-999 customer_id = CUST-456 (Michael)
- Current user customer_id = CUST-123 (Rohan)
- CUST-123 ≠ CUST-456
- ❌ ACCESS DENIED

Response: "I can only show you your own orders. Would you like to see your order history?"
```

```
Scenario B: Support Agent views order
Emma (Support Agent): "Show me order ORD-999"

AI checks:
- Emma's role = "support_agent"
- Support agents can view any order ✅
- Shows order details

Response: "Order ORD-999 for Michael Chen..."
```
